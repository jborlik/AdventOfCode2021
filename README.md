Python code to solve daily puzzles of http://adventofcode.com/2021

Code is tested with Python 3.8.3 (Anaconda distribution) on Win10. Developed with VSCode.

## Days

* Day 1:  Numpy functions for computing array differences.  Stumbled a bit with a sliding array on part 2.  I got to it late, but it took only a couple of minutes.
